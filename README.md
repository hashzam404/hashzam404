 - Intro -
Hello!
I’m Hisham Gannouni (known as @hashzam404),
I've been self-taught in programming from a young age and have always lurked
on the internet, but never got to the point of putting myself out until now as an adult.

 - Interests? -
My overall interest is in the development between hardware and software systems. I find 
passion in various fields in programming and engineering. I can sit and program for hours
or work on a machine with my hands, both give me the biggest pleassure of happiness. 

 - Why now? - 
I plan on sharing what I've done over the years on here. I'll salvage and prepare some
documentation on them. Some are complex, stuff I've never seen docs on, so after many
years, I am happy to share them with the internet. 

 - What languages do you know? -
I'm currently familiar with a number of programming languages, including:
 - Python, Processing, Java, Javascript, C++
 - Perl, HTML, XML, PHP, Ruby, Rust, CSS
 - CURL, Swift (Apple), BASH (Unix and Linux port), BATCH (Windows & MS-DOS), BASIC
 - HLA (High Level Assembly), LUA
 - Some programming languages introduced in games like Garry's Mod Wiremod and Minecraft

 - What are you working on now? -
I’m currently learning Fortran since it is quick at crunching through number operations.
I plan on making a backend math library based on it so it can be integrated with other languages.
(Example: A slow but elegant Java application that needs to run rapid calculations in the background)
This has been somewhat done before, but not exactly. There have been complex integrations, but not 
a function-based library from what I've researched.
